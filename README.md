## Movie Countdown Twitter Bot
A simple Twitter bot to countdown the days for a movie premiere. 
(Specifically, "The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent," starring Nic Cage and Pedro Pascal, but this can be edited to countdown to anything.)

# Functionality
Uses Tweepy API to send daily tweets to my bot, @TUWOMTCountdown, until the premiere arrives.
(Server/Serverless TBD)

# How to Use
TBD
(I don't know yet, but this can be used to tweet anything on a daily basis with extra mods. But generally can be used to countdown to any date and tweet out the countdown)
