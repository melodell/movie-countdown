# Movie Countdown Twitter Bot
A simple Twitter bot to countdown the days for a movie premiere. 
(Specifically, right now, "The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent," starring Nic Cage and Pedro Pascal, but this can be edited to countdown to anything.)

## Functionality
Uses Tweepy API to send daily tweets to a bot account until the premiere arrives.
Deployed to Heroku and scheduled to make daily tweets.

## Post-Premiere Update
Tweets were retweeted DAILY by the official movie account, [@NickCageMovie](https://twitter.com/NickCageMovie)!
